I did data analysis with NBA teams on correlations between game performance stats (Points, rebounds, assists...) and the total number of fan attendees. 

## Data Files

The `main.py` script is designed to analyze NBA fan attendance data.
- The primary data file for use with this script is `data`.
- The files `data2`, `data3`, and `data4` contain different datasets and are not compatible with `main.py`.
